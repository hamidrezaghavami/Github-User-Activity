# Task Tracker CLI 📝

A simple **Command-Line Task Tracker** built with **Node.js**.  
This project is part of my learning journey from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker).

## 📌 Project Overview
The Task Tracker CLI allows you to:
- Add tasks
- List tasks
- Mark tasks as in progress or done
- Delete tasks
- Save tasks persistently to a local file (JSON)

It’s a great hands-on project for practicing Node.js, CLI development, and file system operations.
